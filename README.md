# React + TypeScript + Vite

ðŸ§© Task: Build a mini task management system with the following features:

Add tasks with priority: Low, Medium, or High

Default priority is Low

Each task includes a countdown timer:

Low â€“ 7 minutes

Medium â€“ 5 minutes

High â€“ 3 minutes


The list should auto-sort based on time left

When a timer hits zero, the task should blink and then auto-delete
